## Problem Statement
The human resources department of a company needs to gain deeper insights into their workforce to make informed decisions regarding employee management, retention, performance improvement, and strategic planning. They require a detailed analysis of various aspects such as gender distribution, average tenure, turnover rates, salary distributions, and correlations between education levels and performance ratings.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the company's human resources data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve employee satisfaction, optimize workforce management, and enhance overall organizational performance.

## Hypothesis

- Higher education levels are associated with higher performance ratings and salaries.
- There are noticeable gender disparities in certain departments.
- Turnover rates vary significantly across departments, with some experiencing higher rates than others.
- Performance ratings are positively correlated with salaries.
- Tenure and age distributions vary significantly across departments, impacting department-specific strategies.


## Data Overview

The data used in this d project is generated using a combination of ChatGPT prompts and the Python Faker library. This dataset simulates a set of employee information typically found in HR systems, including demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data. The generated data is designed to mimic real-world HR data, providing a rich dataset for analysis and visualization in Tableau.
